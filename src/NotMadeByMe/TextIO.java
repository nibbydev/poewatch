/**
 * TextIO provides a set of static methods for reading and writing text.  By default, it reads
 * from standard input and writes to standard output, but it is possible to redirect the input
 * and output to files or to other input and output streams.  When the standard input and output
 * streams are being used, the input methods will not produce an error; instead, the user is
 * repeatedly prompted for input until a legal input is entered.  (If standard input has been
 * changed externally, as by file redirection on the command line, this is not a reasonable
 * behavior; to handle this case, TextIO will give up after 10 consecutive illegal inputs and
 * will throw an IllegalArgumentException.)  For the most part, any other
 * error will be translated into an IllegalArguementException.
 * <p>For writing to standard output, the output methods in this class pretty much
 * duplicate the functionality of System.out, and System.out can be used interchangeably with them.
 * <p>This class does not use optimal Java programming practices.  It is designed specifically to be easily
 * usable even by a beginning programmer who has not yet learned about objects and exceptions.  Therefore,
 * everything is in a single source file that compiles into a single class file, all the methods are
 * static methods, and none of the methods throw exceptions that would require try...catch statements.
 * Also for this reason, all exceptions are converted into IllegalArgumentExceptions, even when this
 * exception type doesn't really make sense.
 * <p>This class requires Java 5.0 or higher. (A previous version of TextIO required only Java 1.1;
 * this version should work with any source code that used the previous version, but it has some new
 * features, including the type of formatted output that was introduced in Java 5 and the ability to
 * use files and streams.)
