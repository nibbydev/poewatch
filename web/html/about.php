              <p>Where do you get the prices?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>The official stash API over from pathofexile.com. Prices are automatically generated from the items players publicly list for sale.</span></p>
              <p>How up to date are the prices?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>All prices are recalculated within 60 second intervals. Prices on the website are always the most recent unless stated otherwise.</span></p>
              <p>What do the 'change' and 'count' columns mean?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Change refers to how much the price has changed when comparing the price right now and 7 days ago. Count means how many of that item is listed every 24 hours.</span></p>
              <p>The currency page is cluttered with too many different items.<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Use the Group search option to filter based on Currency, Essences and other groups.</span></p>
              <p>How do you acquire account and character names?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Through the stash API. Meaning that if a player has listed an item in a public stash tab, that character is recorded.</span></p>
              <p>Why doesn't a character from X league show up in the characters page?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Only users who have listed something on sale using public stash tabs have that specific character recorded.</span></p>
              <p>Is this site somehow related to poe.ninja?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>No, although it was inspired by it.</span></p>
              <p>What's the benefit of using this over poe.ninja?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Additional features such as the ability to view prices from past leagues, see the quantities of items being listed each day, character search, linking specific items, saving searches, and a sleek UI.</span></p>
              <p>Item X has an incredibly high price at league start. Why?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Quite often the first person to find a particular item during a new league will list it for much more than it's actually worth.</span></p>
              <p>Can you make feature X on this site less frustrating to use?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Do let me know and I'll see how it can be improved.</span></p>
              <p>Why is there no data for day one of new leagues?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Timezones. Leagues usually start at 8 PM UTC, which leaves a total of 4 hours for day one. Not really enough to get any useful statistics. Which is why the first day is skipped and the next one includes the whole 24 + 4 hours of data.</span></p>
              <p>What are the API limitations?<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>Based on fair use. Though it does have a rate limitation of 4 requests per second - 10 second timeout.</span></p>
              <p>Some of the pages don't work with Internet Explorer<br><span class='custom-text-gray-lo'>More like Internet Explorer doesn't work with some of the pages. But seriously, it's an outdated browser. You should upgrade to something newer.</span></p>
